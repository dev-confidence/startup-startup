Write Tests & Code (TDD)\r\n2. Commit & Push to Github for `Code Review` as Pull Request\r\n3. Other team member reviews Pull Request & comments accordingly\r\n4. Travis CI builds all branches (inc. Pull Requests) & runs all tests (unit, functional, acceptance) \r\n5. Coveralls runs `Code Coverage` report\r\n6. Scrutinizer runs `Static Code Analysis` report\r\n6. If `step 4` is **successful**: \r\n     a. Create Git Tag / Release on Github (these are release candidates)\r\n     b. Deploy Git Tag to `CI environment`\r\n7. Test on `CI environment`\r\n8. Deploy to `Test environment` from any `tag / release` as required\r\n\r\n![Continuous Delivery Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev-confidence/startup-startup/master/docs/img/continuous_delivery.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
